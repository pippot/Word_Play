    The Environment object represents the entire simulation.

    Assumptions:
        - New agents will not be added to the Environment after initialization. However, agents can be delete (e.g.,
          if an agent dies). And new non-agent entities can be added.

    Info:
        - Agent actions are collected simultaneously and their execution and conflict resolution according to the
          Agent Environment Cycle (AEC) protocol. E.g., all entities (including agents) have a specified turn order
          (this turn order could be random) and actions are executed sequentially in accordance to this entity
          ordering. For example, if two agents both select to pick up the same object, then only the first agent
          will pick up the object and the second agent's action will fail resulting in no action for the second
          agent. If desired, the Environment class can be inherited from and edited to allow for custom conflict
          resolution system (e.g., if both agents try to pick up the same object, neither of their actions succeed
          and they both receive a penalty). Alternatively, agents also implement this type of logic for specific
          actions using custom actions and a custom conflict resolution component.
