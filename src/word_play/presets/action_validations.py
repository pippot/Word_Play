"""
Built-in Action_Validation classes.

`Target_Is_Self`, `Target_Not_Self`, and `Target_Is_Nearby` remain implemented in
core because `Environment.possible_actions()` relies on their concrete classes for
search optimizations. They are re-exported here so users can discover and import
all built-in validators from one place.

Those three validators have special meaning to the engine:

- `Target_Is_Self` restricts the action's target to the acting entity itself. This
  is the right validator for actions like waiting, moving, healing yourself, or
  any other action that conceptually targets "me".
- `Target_Not_Self` excludes the acting entity from the candidate targets. This is
  useful for actions that may target many entities but should never target the
  actor.
- `Target_Is_Nearby` restricts candidate targets to entities considered nearby by
  the environment's movement system. This is useful for local interactions like
  melee attacks, pickup actions, and trading with adjacent entities.

Because `Environment.possible_actions()` recognizes these concrete classes, using
them can substantially reduce the number of target entities the engine needs to
check when enumerating actions.
