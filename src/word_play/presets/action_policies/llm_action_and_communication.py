# TODO: this is just a template, this class needs to be implemented. This class should use some general LLM API so that
#       it can switch to use different LLMs very easily. It should not store the LLM in memory, since if we have many
#       agents, we don't want many copies of the same LLM. It should also manage its memory, e.g., it is responsible for
#       storing information about past observations and past chats with other agents.
#       This class should accept a Human_LLM class as input for its LLM (e.g., see model_presets.py). The Human_LLM
#       model sees the exact same thing as the LLM, the only difference is that the human is generating text instead of
#       the LLM. This is a very useful class for testing and debugging.
